# Homework Problems
Please complete both of these problems. These problems are relevant and helpful to understanding Project 1.
1. Write a script that creates a 15,000-meter buffer around features in the airports.shp feature class classified as an airport ( based on the FEATUREfield ) and a 7,500-meter buffer around features classified as a seaplane base. The results should be two separate feature classes, one for each airport type.
2. Write a script that adds a text field to the roads.shp feature class called FERRY and populates this field with YES and NO values, depending on the value of the FEATURE field.
