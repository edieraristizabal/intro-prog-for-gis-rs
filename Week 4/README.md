# Lecture
We will begin by setting up our Jupyter Notebook using ArcGIS Pro. Then, we will work with our local jupyter notebook to understand how to describe data and work with text files and CSVs.

# Data
- af_dem_30s.tif (and other DEMs)
- Features.gdb
- OSM.gdb
- Monthly_Pre-Existing_Condition_Insurance_Plan_Enrollment__State_by_State.csv
- coordinates.txt

# In-Class Exercises
- (**OLD**) Please complete **Exercise05.pdf**. Please submit the scripts that you create through the exercise (my_clip.py, centroid.py, distance.py). 

# Homework Problems
- Please complete any 3 of the 4 **Challenge** exercises on pages 22 and 23 and submit your answers as individual Python (.py) scripts.
 
# Challenge (if the homework is too easy!)
- **freq.py** - Write a Python script to solve the following problem. The input data can be found in **ch06.zip**. The land cover types in 'park.shp' include 'woods', 'orchards', and 'other.' Park rangers would like a table including the frequencies of polygons with each cover type. Write a script to perform Frequency (Analysis) on the 'COVER' field that will generate this table. Name the output 'COVER_freq.dbf'.
