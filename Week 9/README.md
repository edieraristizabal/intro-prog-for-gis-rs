# Assignment
In the Week 11 Content folder, you will see:
- ArcMap Exercise 1
- Exercise 2 - Scripting the Mosaic Dataset Creation
- ArcMap Exercise 3

Please do these exercises in this order. Only **Exercise 2** will generate a Python script. Please submit that Python script here.

If you complete these three exercises **within 3 hours**, I would like you to **script out the workflow for Exercise 3**. Consider this to be an **optional challenge problem**! Understand that you should be able to use the script you wrote for Exercise 2 as a starting point. Please submit that script here too.
