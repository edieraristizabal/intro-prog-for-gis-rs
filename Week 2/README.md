- (From Page 93 of Tateosian) For this problem, I am assuming that you have taken the folder and data in **ch05.zip** and placed it in C:/gispy. If you have placed it in another folder, use that path as the 'Input Features' path and 'Scratch Workspace' path. Try the following steps to experiment with environment settings and answer the questions that follow:
  1. Launch ArcCatalog (or ArcMap).
  2. Search for the Buffer (Analysis) tool in the search window.
  3. Double click on the tool link to launch the tool dialog.
  4. Drag C:/gispy/data/ch05/park.shp into the 'Input Features' parameter box.
  5. Observe the 'Output Feature Class' path.
  6. Cancel the tool.
  7. Open the environment settings dialog (Geoprocessing -> Environments...).
  8. Click on Workspacecs to expand this category.
  9. Set 'Scratch Workspace' to C:/gispy/scratch'.
  10. Click OK to accept the changes and close the dialog box.
  11. Repeat steps 2 - 5.
  12. Follow-up questions:
    - Explain the effect of changing 'Scratch Workspace' Environment Settings in the example.
    - Write a line of Python code that, in a script, would achieve the same effect as step 9.
