# Please complete the following problems:

1. Write a temperature conversion script to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit, using the following equations for  the conversion:
  - F = 1.8 * C + 32
  - C = (0.56)*(F - 32)
  
  The Script should take one numerical required argument and one optional argument (the scale, F or C). If the user gives one argument, a     number, assume that the number is given in Fahrenheit.
  
  The printed statements should look something like the following:
  - 32 Fahrenheit is equivalent to 0.0 Celsius
  - 100 Celsius is equivalent to 212.0 Fahrenheit
