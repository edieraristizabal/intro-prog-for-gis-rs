# Please complete the following problems:

1. Write a temperature conversion script to convert between Celsius and Farenheit, using the following equations for  the conversion:
  - F = 1.8*C + 32
  - C = (0.56)*(F - 32)
  
  The Script should take one numerical required argument and one optional argument (the scale, F or C). If the user gives one argument, a number, assume that the number is given in Farenheit
