# Lecture
In this lecture, we will learn about geometry objects. Geometries are the shapes of features. We will see how to extract them, manipulate them, and the different formats they are stored in.

# Homework Questions
1. What are the three types of cursors and what purpose does each serve?
2. What module do you import to access cursors?
3. Explain the difference between the [ArcGIS Field Calculator](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/data-management/calculate-field.htm) and Upate Cursors? How are they similar?

# Homework Problems
Please complete both of these problems. These problems are relevant and helpful to understanding Project 1.
1. Write a script that creates a 15,000-meter buffer around features in the airports.shp feature class classified as an airport ( based on the FEATUREfield ) and a 7,500-meter buffer around features classified as a seaplane base. The results should be two separate feature classes, one for each airport type.
2. Write a script that adds a text field to the roads.shp feature class called FERRY and populates this field with YES and NO values, depending on the value of the FEATURE field.
