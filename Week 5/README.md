# Lecture
In this lecture, we will learn about geometry objects. Geometries are the shapes of features. We will see how to extract them, manipulate them, and the different formats they are stored in.

# Terminology
## [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry)
Well-known text (WKT) is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map. A binary equivalent, known as well-known binary (WKB), is used to transfer and store the same information on databases. The formats were originally defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and described in their Simple Feature Access.[1] The current standard definition is in the ISO/IEC 13249-3:2016 standard.

## [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

## [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution.

# In-Class Exercises
Please complete [Exercise 9 from Python Scripting for ArcGIS Pro](https://learngis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f8e466f8f2c2481f9a3c820ccfc1c35f). You can find the data [here](https://learngis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ce6ad466cd064a7099ee65de7bba3a49). I recommend trying this in an Jupyter notebook rather than IDLE. Please submit the notebook if you do this in Jupyter. Submit the Python scripts if you do it in IDLE or PyCharm.
