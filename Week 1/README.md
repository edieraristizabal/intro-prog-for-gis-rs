  - Consider the following list:
  
  ```mylist = ["Athens", "Barcelona", "Cairo", "Florence", "Helsinki"]```
  
  Determine the results of the following:
    - ```len(mylist)```
    - ```mylist[2]```
    - ```mylist[1:]```
    - ```mylist[-1]```
    - ```mylist.index("Cairo")```
    - ```mylist.pop(1)```
    - ```mylist.sort(reverse = True)```
    - ```mylist.append("Berlin")```
  These operations are all to be performed on the original listâ€”that is, not
  as a sequence of operations. Try to determine the answer manually first,
  and then check your result by running the code.
