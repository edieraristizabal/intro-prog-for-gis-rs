  1. Consider the following variable called ```happyCow```
  
  ```happyCow = 'meadows.shp'```
  
  Determine the following:
    - ```happyCow[0]```
    - ```happyCow[0:5] + happyCow[-4:]```
    - ```len(happyCow)```
    - ```happyCow[0:5]```
    - ```happyCow[-4:]```
    - ```happyCow[11]```
    - ```happyCow[:5]```
    - ```happyCow in "5meadows.shp"```
    - ```happyCow[5]```
    - ```'W' in happyCow```
  
  2. Determine if each statement is ```True``` or ```False``` using the variable ```LCS_ID = '0017238'```
    - ```17 in LCS_ID``` 
    - ```LCS_ID.isdigit()```
    - ```LCS_ID.lstrip('0') == '17238'```
    - ```LCS_ID.zfill(10) == '10101010'```
    - ```LCS_ID + '10' = 17248```
    - ```LCS_ID[6] == '3'```
    - ```len(LCS_ID) == 7```
    - ```LCS_ID[0:7] == '0017238'```
    - ```int(LCS_ID) + 10 == 17248```
    - ```LCS_ID != 17238```
  
  3. TEST
  
  4. Consider the following list:
  
  ```mylist = ["Athens", "Barcelona", "Cairo", "Florence", "Helsinki"]```
  
  Determine the results of the following:
    - ```len(mylist)```
    - ```mylist[2]```
    - ```mylist[1:]```
    - ```mylist[-1]```
    - ```mylist.index("Cairo")```
    - ```mylist.pop(1)```
    - ```mylist.sort(reverse = True)```
    - ```mylist.append("Berlin")```
    
  These operations are all to be performed on the original listâ€”that is, not
  as a sequence of operations. Try to determine the answer manually first,
  and then check your result by running the code.
