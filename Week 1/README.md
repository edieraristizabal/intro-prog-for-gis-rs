  - Consider the following list:
```mylist = ["Athens", "Barcelona", "Cairo", "Florence", "Helsinki"]```
Determine the results of the following:
a) ```len(mylist)```
b) ```mylist[2]```
c) ```mylist[1:]```
d) ```mylist[-1]```
e) ```mylist.index("Cairo")```
f) ```mylist.pop(1)```
g) ```mylist.sort(reverse = True)```
h) ```mylist.append("Berlin")```
These operations are all to be performed on the original listâ€”that is, not
as a sequence of operations. Try to determine the answer manually first,
and then check your result by running the code.
