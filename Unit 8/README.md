Complete the following problems

## Problem 1
Create a custom function called countstringfields that determines the number of fields of type string in an input feature class. Create this function in a separate script ( for example, **mycount.py**) that you call from another script ( for example, **callingscript.py**). You can use the **streets.shp** feature class in the **Exercise12** folder.

## Problem 2
You are given a feature class called **parcels.shp** located in the **Exercise12** folder that contains the following fields: FID, Shape, Landuse, and Value. Modify the parceltax.py script so that it determines the property tax for each parcel and stores these values in a list. You should use the class created in the parcelclass.py script â€” the class can remain unchanged. Print the values of the final list as follows: FID: <property tax>
